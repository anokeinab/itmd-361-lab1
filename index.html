  <p>Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  
  <p>I'm a transfer student from City Colleges of Chicago where I got my Associates Degree in Computer Science last summer. </p>
  <p>I always wanted to learn how to design websites unfortunately I kept procrastinating.</p>
  <p>Now that I'm taking this class I hope that I will learn more about web programming. </p>
  <p>I hope we will all have a lot of fun with Daniel and learn a lot from him.</p>
  <p>Thank You. </p>
